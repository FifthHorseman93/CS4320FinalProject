## Google Translate + Weather Data
- API list says that YR.NO is "the largest weather database in the world", but it's in Norwegian
- YR.NO appears very easy to use, no sign-up required

Google Translate Cloud API:

YR.NO API:
http://www.yr.no/artikkel/information-about-the-free-data-1.6810075

Problems:
- Google Translate Cloud API isn't free (providing a credit card gets $300 of use, good for 12 months, but I couldn't find detailed documentation on how much their billing is for API use or how long $300 would likely last)
- yr.no documentation is in Norwegian (but surfing through Google Translate is pretty effective, translation appears accurate)
